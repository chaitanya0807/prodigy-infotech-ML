# Food Item Recognition and Calorie Estimation

## Project Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content. By leveraging deep learning techniques, users can track dietary intake and make informed food choices based on the recognized food items.

## Dataset

The project uses the [Food-101 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101), which contains 101,000 images of food items across 101 categories. Each category consists of 1,000 images, allowing the model to learn diverse representations of food items.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the Food-101 dataset and place it in the designated directory.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: The script loads and preprocesses images from the dataset, resizing them to 128x128 pixels and normalizing pixel values.

2. **Model Training**: The CNN model is built and trained using the training set. The model architecture consists of several convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and dense layers.

3. **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated on the test set, and the accuracy is printed.

4. **Prediction**: You can predict food items from new images by using the `predict_calorie` function.

```python
image_path = 'path_to_test_image.jpg'
food_item = predict_calorie(image_path)
print(f'Predicted food item: {food_item}')
```

## Results

The model achieves a test accuracy of approximately XX%. You can enhance the model by fine-tuning hyperparameters or utilizing transfer learning techniques with pre-trained models.

### Notes:
- Make sure to replace placeholders like `<repository_url>` and `XX%` with actual values.
- Add a `requirements.txt` file to specify the libraries used.
- Adjust the content to reflect any additional features or specific details of your project.
